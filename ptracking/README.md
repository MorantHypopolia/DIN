ptracking
=========

# Requirements

ptracking requires the following packages to build:
  
  * build-essential
  * g++
  * cmake
  * libxml2
  * boost
  * CGAL

while these requirements are optional to build PViewer and PVisualizer:
  
  * gnuplot (PViewer)
  * opencv (PVisualizer)

while these requirements are mandatory if and only if, you are running a
64-bit Linux distribution but the library have to be compiled for a 32-bit
Linux distribution:
  
  * libc6-dev-i386
  * libgmp3-dev

On Xubuntu (Ubuntu) 12.04.4 LTS (Kernel 3.2.0-68) these dependencies are resolved by installing the
following packages:
  
  - build-essential
  - cmake
  - libxml2
  - libxml2-dev
  - libboost1.46-all-dev
  - libcgal-dev
  - gnuplot (optional)
  - gnuplot-x11 (optional)
  - libopencv-dev (optional)
  - libc6-dev-i386 (32-bit Linux distribution)
  - libgmp3-dev (32-bit Linux distribution)

# How to build

The only development platform is Linux. We recommend a so-called out of source
build which can be achieved by the following command sequence:
  
  - mkdir build
  - cd build
  - cmake ../src
  - make -j\<number-of-cores+1\>

# Installation

Once the build phase has been successfully, the library have to be installed
so that it can be linked in other projects. This is achieved by the
following command sequence:
  
  - cd build
  - sudo make install

After the installation the header files have been copied to /usr/local/include/PTracking,
while the libptracking.so shared object has been copied to /usr/local/lib/PTracking.

The executables:
  
  * PLearner
  * PTracker
  * PViewer
  * PVisualizer

have been copied to /usr/local/bin.

The last step before correctly using the library is to logout because the file ~/.profile
has been modified by the installation.

# Usage

Before executing any program, you need to verify in the parameters.cfg file whether the
filtering parameters are suitable for the chosen environment.
  
  * To execute the tracking algorithm you just need to have an observation file and type in to a
    terminal the following command:
    
    - PTracker \<path-observation-file\>
  
  * To visualize in Gnuplot the tracking data generated by PTracker type in to another terminal:
    
    - PViewer
